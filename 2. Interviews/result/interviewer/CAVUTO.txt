All right, there are sanctuary cities and towns, but a sanctuary state?
What can you do if you are not going to get local help in trying to track down folks you say not only shouldn't be here, but they're a threat to people here?
So, Director, what do you do if local police turn the other way and say, all right, our loyalty is to the governor?
How do you follow up on that, though? How do you search these individuals out without looking, as I think the governor was intimating, like the Gestapo?
But what if they do just that? What do you do?
What if they do just that? What do you do?
But they are, director, right? In a lot of cases, they're just that. Then what do you if they're protecting or there's a shield of protection around such individuals? How do you force the point?
Does the president share your views, sir?
And he's told you that?
Director, thank you for taking the time.
All right.
