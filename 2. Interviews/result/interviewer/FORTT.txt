THANK YOU, SARA. I'M HERE WITH SATYA NADELLA, CEO OF MICROSOFT AND THE AUTHOR OF "HIT REFRESH: THE QUEST TO REDISCOVER MICROSOFT'S SOUL AND IMAGINE A BETTER FUTURE FOR EVERYONE." THIS IS ABOUT CULTURAL CHANGE, THE FUTURE, A LITTLE OF YOUR PERSONAL BACKGROUND. SO, HITTING REFRESH ON MICROSOFT. YOU HIT REFRESH. HAS THE NEW ELEMENT ON THE PAGE LOADED YET OR ARE WE STILL WAITING?
BILL GATES.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY WHY WRITE A BOOK NOW, WHY WRITE A BOOK NOW? SOME PEOPLE WRITE A BOOK AFTER THEY'VE RETIRED OR AFTER, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE HIT SOME OBVIOUS SUCCESS POINT. YOU SAID THIS IS NOT A MEMOIR, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO SAY THAT THE GAME IS OVER AND YOU'VE WON. IS THIS KIND OF CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE MOMENT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THIS FOR MICROSOFT'S EMPLOYEES AND PERSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS SAYING, LOOK, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO?
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT IN THE BOOK IS PRIVACY VERSUS SECURITY. WE'VE JUST HAD THE CEO OF EQUIFAX RESIGN IN THE WAKE OF THAT HUGE DATA BREACH. 143 MILLION ACCOUNTS COMPROMISED. MAYBE NOT ON PAPER THE WORST PRIVACY BREACH EVER, BUT I WOULD ARGUE IT IS THE WORST IN TERMS OF THE IMPACTS ON CONSUMERS. IS MICROSOFT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO TECHNOLOGY'S POTENTIAL DARKSIDE, EVEN AS YOU LOOK AHEAD TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES, TO PREVENT THE EQUIVALENT OF AN EQUIFAX HAPPENING TEN YEARS DOWN THE LINE IN THE A.I. ERA?
BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN SAID OF THE INTERNET, WASNT BUILT FOR SECURITY, RIGHT, IF IT HAD BEEN BUILT INHERENTLY SECURE, THAT WOULD BE BETTER. IS MACHINE LEARNING AND A.I. THE CONSTRUCTS YOURE BUILDING, ARE THEY BEING BUILT WITH SECURITY AND THE POTENTIAL DARK SIDE IN MIND?
WHAT'S THAT MEAN IN THE TECHNOLOGY SENSE?
WHAT ABOUT BUSINESSES LIKE EQUIFAX, IF THEY HAD BEEN ON YOUR CLOUD WOULD YOU HAVE HAD ANY KIND OF EARLY WARNING SYSTEM THAT WOULD HAVE ALERTED THEM THAT THIS VULNERABILITY WAS BEING EXPLOITED, AND THEY WERE LOSING DATA?
IT'S BEEN ABOUT TEN MONTHS SINCE THE LINKEDIN ACQUISITION OFFICIALLY CLOSED, I BELIEVE, $26 BILLION, BIG BUY. HOW LONG BEFORE WE SEE  WE LOOK ADD LINKEDIN AND SEE OFFICE 365 COMPLETELY BAKED IN, WE LOOK AT OFFICE, WE SEE LINKEDIN. AND THERE'S MORE OF THAT MIXING OF THE TWO PLATFORMS.
IN THE BOOK YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE COMING TO THE U.S. AS A 21 YEAR OLD, BEING ON THIS COLLEGE CAMPUS, AND THEN GOING TO WORK FOR MICROSOFT. AND IN IT YOU TALK ALSO ABOUT HOW YOU TRANSITIONED FROM BEING THIS LONE WORKER TO GETTING MARRIED AND BEING A FAMILY MAN, AND YOU HAD A GREEN CARD THIS I DIDN'T REALIZE ABOUT YOU, IM GOING TO READ JUST A PORTION FROM IT. YOU HAD A GREEN CARD AND YOU SAY YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET MARRIED TO YOUR WIFE. "THE H1B ENABLES SPOUSES TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES WHILE THEIR HUSBANDS AND WIVES ARE WORKING HERE, SUCH IS THE PERVERSE IMMIGRATION LAW, THERE'S NOTHING I COULD DO ABOUT IT. ANU, MY WIFE TO BE, WAS MY TOP PRIORITY AND THAT MADE MY DECISION A SIMPLE ONE. I WENT BACK TO THE U.S. EMBASSY IN DELHI IN JUNE OF 1994, PASSED THE ENORMOUS LINES OF PEOPLE HOPING TO GET A VISA AND TOLD THE CLERK I WANTED TO GIVE BACK MY GREEN CARD AND APPLY FOR AN H1B. HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED." YOU GAVE UP YOUR GREEN CARD, BECAUSE U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW AT THE TIME SAID YOUR WIFE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT FIVE YEARS AT LEAST TO COME OVER. HOW DOES THAT INFORM THE WAY YOU AS THE CEO OF MICROSOFT LOOK AT THIS IMMIGRATION DEBATE THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW?
MICROSOFT'S IMMIGRATION LAWYER AT MICROSOFT WAS ONE WHO SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT MAYBE YOU NEEDED TO SHIFT FROM A GREEN CARD TO AN H1B TO DO THAT. NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT KIND OF EXPERT ADVICE IN PLACE, AND SOME WOULD ARGUE OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM HASN'T BEEN ENLIGHTENED FOR A LONG TIME, IF EVER HOW DO WE GET THERE? HOW DOES MICROSOFT HELP US GET THERE?
LET'S SAY YOU'RE LEADING A GREAT POWER WITH A PROUD LEGACY OF DOMINANCE, BUT YOU SEE THAT TRUST IS BREAKING DOWN IN THE CULTURE AND THE INFIGHTING IS KEEPING MEANINGFUL WORK FROM GETTING DONE. COULD BE TALKING ABOUT MICROSOFT, COULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. CAN AMERICA HIT REFRESH? HOW?
MICROSOFT IS A SPONSOR OF THE NFL. YOUR SURFACE TABLETS AND COMPUTERS ARE ALL AROUND THE FIELD BEING USED MORE AND MORE.
AS YOU LOOK AT WHAT SURFACE HAS DONE WITH THIS NFL RELATIONSHIP, HAS IT WORKED? IS THE NFL EFFECTIVE IN ITS PLATFORM FOR A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, AND IS IT BECOMING MORE EFFECTIVE OR LESS SO?
CRICKET BEFORE THAT.
I WANT TO ASK FINALLY ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. YOU'VE GOT THIS A.I. AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GROUP THAT'S GROWN FROM 5,000 PEOPLE TO 8,000 PEOPLE JUST IN THE PAST YEAR. IT'S NOW MORE THAN 5% OF MICROSOFTS HEAD COUNT. HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE WITHOUT FALLING INTO THAT OLD XEROX PARK TRAP OF HAVING ALL THESE RESEARCHERS IN A GROUP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OUT THE DOOR?
AND THE PARTNERSHIPS YOU'VE BEEN DOING LATELY, CORTANA, MICROSOFTS SPEECH AGENT, TALKING TO ALEXA WITH JEFF BEZOS AT AMAZON, ISNT THAT RISKY?
YEAH, HOPEFULLY THOSE TWO A.I. KIDS WILL BE GOOD INFLUENCES ON EACH OTHER AND WON'T GET INTO TOO MUCH TROUBLE. SATYA NADELLA, CEO OF MICROSOFT, AUTHOR OF "HIT REFRESH," THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
