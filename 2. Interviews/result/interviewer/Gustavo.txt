Wonderful to meet you too, Brittany. Your office is great. What a view!
How long has the company been headquartered here?
I've  been reading about the company. It's quite a story!
For sure. You're looking for a Payroll Supervisor, and that's my experience. I'm curious. Why do you need a Payroll Supervisor? Do you process the payroll in-house?
And so the person who works in the payroll department now ...?
Can you tell me about how the HR department is organized?
So would it be fair to say that as Payroll positions go, this one is very HR-focused?
Great. That really helps. Can you tell me about the major issues you're facing in Payroll?
And is there a benefits hotline or online portal for your employees to get benefits answers from?
So there must be deductions from paychecks for some of those benefit plans --
I ran a Payroll department from 2002 to 2011 for the City of Townsville. They outsourced their payroll process completely in 2011 and I started consulting, but I missed being on a team. I learned a tremendous amount consulting, so that was great. I took a contract job running the payroll for the Townsville Shakespeare Festival for two years but it was quite a placeholder job, in that there are no plans to grow the staff size or update the processes or innovate in HR and that makes sense for the Festival organization, but of course there wasn't a lot of challenge for me.
Glad to hear that! Can I ask you a question about your plans for growth in headcount?
Only because I've been through growth-and-contraction cycles before, I wonder, will any of that hiring be contingent or will everybody be on the payroll?
And of course those people are paid through temp firms.
Fantastic! And how do you view pay ranges? Is there a philosophical point of view on that?
Negotiate? Can you tell me more about that?
Apart from the temp firms, what are the other principal sources for your new hires?
What would you like to know about me and my background?
