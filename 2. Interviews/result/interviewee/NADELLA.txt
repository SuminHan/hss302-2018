YOU KNOW, TO ME, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BILL WRITES IN THE FORWARD I THINK CAPTURES 
RIGHT  BILL GATES - CAPTURES THE SENSE OF HIT REFRESH AND THE LOGIC BEHIND IT, WHICH IS YOU'VE GOT TO BE SMART SO THAT THE PAGE LOAD TIMES FAST THAT MEANS, YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE EVERYTHING. YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE THINGS THAT MATTER THE MOST TO BE ABLE TO REALLY GO AFTER THE NEW CONCEPTS. CULTURE AND CULTURE CHANGE IS IN SUPPORT OF, IN OUR CASE, INNOVATION. AND IN TECH THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A CONSTANT, SO THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH NEW CONCEPTS, WHICH NEED NEW CAPABILITY, IS WHAT CULTURE ENABLES. SO CULTURE ON ITS OWN IS NOT JUST AN AGENDA, BUT CULTURE COUPLED WITH NEW INNOVATION IS WHAT REALLY OUR BUSINESS IS ALL ABOUT.
YOU'RE RIGHT. MOST BUSINESS BOOKS ARE WRITTEN LOOKING BACK, EITHER AS GRAND SUCCESSES OR GRAND FAILURES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FELT WAS AS WE ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AMONGST TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE, HOW DO I REFLECT ON THAT PROCESS? THAT'S MORE OF THIS BOOK, AND THIS ENTIRE METAPHOR OF HIT REFRESH IS WE AS INDIVIDUALS ARE DEALING WITH CHANGE ALL THE TIME AND WE'RE HITTING REFRESH. WE LEARN FROM IT. SAME IS TRUE FOR ORGANIZATIONS. AND SAME IS TRUE FOR OUR SOCIETY. SO WHILE IN THE MIDST OF IT, SO TO SPEAK, IN THE FOG OF WAR, ONE OF THE REFLECTIONS, AND THIS IS CLEARLY NOT SOME DESTINATION THAT HAS BEEN REACHED, BUT IT'S MORE A PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS RENEWAL.
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT AS EVERY PART OF OUR LIFE AND EVERY PART OF OUR ECONOMY INCREASINGLY IS DRIVEN BY SOFTWARE AND IS BECOMING DIGITAL, CYBERSECURITY IS TOP OF MIND. IN FACT, IF I LOOK BACK, WITH ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE DARK SIDE AFTER ALL, WITH THE TELEGRAPH THERE WAS WIRE FRAUD. WE HAD TO COME UP WITH BOTH THE LAWS, AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY TO DEAL WITH IT. I THINK THE SAME IS GOING TO BE TRUE, WHETHER IT'S WITH A.I. OR CYBERSECURITY. TO ME AND MICROSOFT, ONE OF THE THING THAT IS WE HAVE TO REALLY STEP UP TO, AND THIS IS SOMETHING EVEN WE STARTED 15 YEARS AGO, IS THE CORE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS HAS GOT TO BE A TOP PRIORITY. WE ARE, AFTER ALL, THE FIRST RESPONDERS, AND SO THEREFORE, REALLY BEING ON TOP OF OUR GAME ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.
THAT'S A GREAT POINT, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE SOMETIMES THINK IS SECURITY IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE COMPLETELY BUILT IN. CLEARLY, THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO SECURE THE PROTOCOLS, THE DATA, AND SO ON. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO REALIZE IS THAT OPERATIONAL SECURITY POSTURE THAT ALL OF US HAVE. IT'S KIND OF LIKE IF SOMEBODY SAID THIS TO ME, YOU CAN'T GET FIT BY LOOKING AT OTHERS GO TO THE GYM. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE GYM.
THAT MEANS IN SOME SENSE YOU HAVE TO REALLY SAY WHAT'S THE DIGITAL ESTATE? WHAT ARE THE INTRUSIONS? WHAT ARE THE ATTACKS? AM I ABLE TO DETECT THEM FAST ENOUGH? AM I ABLE TO REMEDIATE FAST ENOUGH? SO THE OPERATIONAL SECURITY POSTURE IS AS IMPORTANT AS QUOTE, UNQUOTE, THE LOCKS ON YOUR FRONT DOOR. ARE YOU WATCHING, AND IN SOME SENSE IT'S AN INTELLIGENCE GAME. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE AT MICROSOFT, FOR EXAMPLE, USING ONE OF OUR CLOUD SERVICES. THE FACT WE SEE A BILLION PLUS END POINTS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THEM IN REAL TIME, WE USE THE INTELLIGENCE FROM THAT TO SECURE OUR CLOUD. ANYONE USING OFFICE 365 WON'T GET THE MALICIOUS THINGS THAT MAY BE PROPAGATING IN E-MAIL BECAUSE OF OUR ABILITY TO TAKE DATA FROM ONE PLACE AND SECURE IT FROM EVERYONE ELSE.
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS OF EQUIFAX AND THEIR STATE, BUT OVERALL, I THINK, THE MORE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE DATA THAT WE SEE ACROSS OUR DIGITAL ESTATES AND ALL THE GOOD GUYS SHARE THAT DATA, THE BETTER OFF WE WILL BE IN KEEPING ANYONE WHO IS TRYING TO ATTACK, AND THAT, I THINK, IS SOMETHING THAT I AM A PROPONENT OF AT THE INDUSTRY LEVEL.
YEAH, IN FACT, FIRST THING THAT I WANT US TO SORT OF MAKE SURE WE MEASURE OURSELVES AND THE STREET SHOULD MEASURE US IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO LINKEDIN'S ORGANIC GROWTH? WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH HOW LINKEDIN POST-ACQUISITION IS CONTINUING TO ACCELERATE AND THAT'S THE FIRST SIGN OF A VERY HEALTHY FRANCHISE. THEN THERE ARE TWO OBVIOUS AREAS THAT WE CAN REALLY SEE THE INTEGRATIONS. ONE, IN FACT, WE LAUNCHED JUST YESTERDAY WAS THE OFFICE 365 AND LINKEDIN COMING TOGETHER TO HELP PROFESSIONALS WHO USE BOTH THOSE PRODUCTS. IN FACT, YOU COULD HAVE GONE TO A CONFERENCE, USED THE LINKEDIN APP TO FIND THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE CONFERENCE AND THEN NETWORK WITH THEM. THAT IS SORT OF A COOL THING. AND IN OUTLOOK YOU CAN FIND NOW YOUR LINKEDIN CONTACTS. SOMEBODY SENDS YOU MAIL, YOU'LL FIND THEM THERE, SEE THE FILES YOU EXCHANGED, SO THAT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE BUT ANOTHER AREA WHERE IT'S REALLY A GAME CHANGER IS FOR US IN THE DYNAMICS AREA WE NOW HAVE SOLUTIONS, WHICH BRING TOGETHER THE LINKEDIN SALES NAVIGATOR WITH CRM, OUR DYNAMICS 365 CRM, AND THAT'S A GAME CHANGER FOR ANYBODY IN THE B 2 B SIDE OF IT. SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE APPLICATIONS SIDE AND OFFICE 365.
THE FIRST THING I'LL SAY, JOHN, IM THE PRODUCT OF TWO AMAZING, UNIQUE AMERICAN THINGS. AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY THAT REACHED ME WHERE I WAS GROWING UP, HELPED ME DREAM THE DREAM, AND THEN THE ENLIGHTENED AMERICAN IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT LET ME COME HERE AND LIVE THE DREAM. SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT, ONLY IN AMERICA WOULD A STORY LIKE MINE BE EVEN POSSIBLE. SO BEFORE WE ARE CRITICAL ABOUT OUR IMMIGRATION POLICY, THE FACT THAT THE U.S. IS THE BEACON OF HOPE AND THE ATTRACTER OF TALENT FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD HOLD AS PRECIOUS THAT'S WHERE THE CRITICISM COMES FROM, NOT IN TERMS OF ANYTHING ELSE HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK, WE CAN'T HAVE AN IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT IS ENLIGHTENED FOR OUR OWN COMPETITIVENESS. IT'S NOT ABOUT DOING THIS OUT OF ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN TO SAY LET US BE THE PLACE WHICH ATTRACTS THE BEST TALENT SO THAT BEST TALENT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SKILLED IMMIGRATION. WE ALSO NEED TO STAND UP FOR BEING THE LAST PLACE OF HOPE FOR MOST PEOPLE -- FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST. THAT'S WHAT, AGAIN, DRIVES AMERICAS UNIQUENESS AND WE SHOULD NEVER, NEVER GIVE IT UP.
I THINK A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT, AGAIN, SPEAKS TO OUR INTERESTS AS A NATION, MAKES US STRONGER, WHAT MAKES US MORE COMPETITIVE, I THINK, IS MUCH NEEDED. SOME OF THINGS, THE IDEA YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR GREEN CARD TO GET AN H1B IS IN RETROSPECT SILLY. LET US TAKE THE REFORM AND SO THAT IT WORKS FOR US, BOTH OUR SECURITY, BUT AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITIVENESS.
I THINK AMERICA AND WHAT IT HAS DONE IN THE 200-PLUS YEARS IS A SOCIETY THAT HAS HIT REFRESH CONSTANTLY. IF ANYTHING, WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR OWN HISTORY IS OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH CHANGE AND REALLY COME UP WITH THE CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED BROAD SPECTRUM. NOT ONLY CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED IN TECHNOLOGY, BUT CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED IN SOCIETY, SO THAT WE CAN BE THE COUNTRY THAT, IN FACT, CREATES THE MOST NEW INNOVATION, CREATES THE MOST NEW OPPORTUNITY. ONE OF THE THINGS I ADMIRE THE MOST ABOUT OUR COUNTRY IS NO OTHER SOCIETY IN HUMAN HISTORY HAS CREATED SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. WE CALL THIS BLUE COLLAR ARISTOCRACY. IT DIDN'T EXIST IN HUMAN HISTORY UNTIL IT WAS FOUND IT THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS PRECIOUS AND ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO HIT REFRESH.
YOU KNOW, FOR ME, I THINK RESPECTING ALL POINTS OF VIEW. IN THIS CASE, THE PLAYERS, THE FANS, AND MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO BRING ABOUT MORE COHESION. UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE OTHER PERSON IS COMING FROM, I THINK, IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR IN ALL OF US. SO THE MORE WE CAN HAVE A RICH DIALOGUE, IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME, BUT LET'S HAVE A RICH DIALOGUE, LET'S HAVE THAT EMPATHY FOR THE OTHER PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, LET US RESPECT THE POINT OF VIEW OF OTHER PEOPLE. THAT IS, I THINK, WHAT HAS MADE AMERICA WHAT IT IS TODAY AND LET US MAKE SURE WE DON'T TRADE THAT OFF.
LOOK, YOU KNOW, FOR ME I LEARNED FOOTBALL WHEN I TURNED 21 AND CAME TO THE UNITED STATES.
IT WAS CRICKET BEFORE THAT. IT'S AN AMAZING SPORT, IT'S AN AMAZING BRAND, AND FOR SURE OUR ASSOCIATION WITH SURFACE AND XBOX AND MANY OTHER TECHNOLOGES WITH THE NFL HAS BEEN FANTASTIC. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE VALUE A LOT AND I KNOW THE NFL VALUES A LOT. WE'VE EVEN LEARNED A LOT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BUILD TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE SIDELINES OF THE NFL, SO WE'RE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, JOHN. IN SOME SENSE THAT'S THE EXISTENTIAL QUESTION FOR US. 43 YEARS AFTER OUR FORMATION, ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALIZED IS WHATEVER NOVEL NEW CONCEPT YOU'VE COME UP WITH, ULTIMATELY, WILL STOP BEING NOVEL. YOU WILL NEED TO COME UP WITH THE NEXT THING IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH THE NEXT THING, YOU HAVE TO PERHAPS BUILD NEW CAPABILITY LIKE A.I. IS SOMETHING WE'VE ALWAYS HAD, BUT WE ARE, IN FACT, HAVE TO BE BUILDING NEW TYPES OF A.I. AND TO DO THAT YOU NEED A CULTURE THAT FOSTERS THAT CAPABILITY BUILDING LONG BEFORE, QUITE FRANKLY, EVEN THE NEW CONCEPT IS CLEAR SO ONE OF THE GREAT BENEFITS IS THE LONG-TERM APPROACH MICROSOFT HAS TAKEN TOWARDS A.I. IT WAS IN 1995 WHEN BILL SAID, YOU KNOW, THE SPEECH RECOGNITION THING IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT. LET'S GET STARTED. RIGHT, WE DIDN'T TURN AROUND JUST YESTERDAY TO START WORKING ON SPEECH SYNTHESIS OR SPEECH RECOGNITION. THAT ABILITY TO TAKE A LONG-TERM APPROACH, BUT THEN SEIZING THESE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARRIVE, AND IT'S NOT THAT YOU PERFECTLY TIMED THEM, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD CAPABILITY AND HAVE A CULTURE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD THE CAPABILITIES SO SEIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES.
LOOK, ALL PARTNERSHIPS CAN BE VIEWED AS -- ALL RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE VIEWED AS ZERO SUM OR MARKET EXPANSIVE. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT AT LEAST I LOOK AT IS WHAT CAN WE DO WERE IN SUCH EARLY DAYS OF THESE VOICE-FIRST DEVICES? THERE ARE PROBABLY, WHAT, 5, 10 MILLION DEVICES, SO IT'S JUST MINUSCULE. I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR US IS START MAKING IT A DAILY HABIT. THIS AMBIENT COMPUTING, I THINK, IS GOING TO BE BIG. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE STRENGTH THAT WE HAVE IS AROUND PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNICATIONS AND THINGS THAT PROFESSIONALS NEED, EVEN IN A VOICE-FIRST WORLD. JUST LIKE HOW WE TOOK OUR OFFICE 365 APPS AND PUT IT ON IOS AND ANDROID, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR VOICE-FIRST APPLICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE ON ALL PLATFORMS, SO THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRUCT BEHIND IT.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.
