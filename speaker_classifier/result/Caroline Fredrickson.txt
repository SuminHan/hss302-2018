Id like to welcome everybody today.  Thank you very much for coming to our national town hall on domestic spying by the National Security Agency.  Im Caroline Fredrickson, and Im the director of the Washington legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union.  Im very pleased to have so many of you in our audience today for this very important discussion.  We have people in our virtual audience as well, since we are streaming this live on the web and filming it.  We do have members of the media present.
