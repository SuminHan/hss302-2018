The Education Committee wants to read a note from the area senior center.Dear students, Thank you very much for volunteering your time and expertise to show us how to use Facebook to connect with our families. Not only did you provide the technical know-how, but you also showed us how to be safe online. We (and our families) appreciate your helping our generation understand this program. Thanks again! Sincerely, Susanna Whitebaum. Not only did they enjoy this, but they would like us to come back to help them learn how to use Google to search. Those members interested should meet with us at 2:30 on Tuesday.
